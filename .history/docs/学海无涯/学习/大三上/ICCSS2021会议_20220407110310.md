# 2021 ICCSS会议
***
这是准备参加2021 ICCSS会议时所写的一点东西和总结。当时以为时线下的会议本不打算参加，但后来延期改成线上了，就硬着头皮去参会了（当时是那个不情愿啊），第三个发言，发言结束，回答完评委专家的问题（估计没听懂）就只想着溜了。

        -  Thanks for introduction. Good afternoon everyone. I am so honored to
            be with you to communicate academic questions and ideas.

        -  My name is Wu Guangheng, a junior student from Jinan university,
            China. Today, I’m going to talk about our recent work about
            BroadSurv: A Novel Broad Learning System-based Approach for Survival
            Analysis.

    -  P2

        -  The content of my presentation is listed as follows.

    -  P3—P5

        -  Here comes the part one. The first thing I would like to talk about
            is survival analysis. ....... as the figure in lower right shows,
            when t=0, S(t) equals 1, as time goes on, the survival probability
            decreases until 0. the data we need to handle in survival analysis
            is called survival data. ........ Survival data is usually faced
            with the problem of censoring.Censoring means that the final event
            is not observed during the research time. We can use a triple
            {X,T,I} to denote the survival data.

    -  P6

        -  Pseudo-observations is regarded as a way to analyze survival data.
            In short, it can generate pseudo survival probability with the
            survival data and help transform a survival analysis problem into a
            regression problem.

    -  P7

        -  Broad learning system proposed by prof. Chen is an effective way to
            solve the regression problem mentioned above. BLS adopts a flat
            structure, and it can achieve faster training speed and higher
            accuracy just by calculating the pseudo-inverse, which can be
            extended to other research fields.

    -  P8—P9

        -  In part two I will introduce our proposed method. As the figure on
            the left side shows, BroadSurv is a two stage method. In the first
            stage, pseudo conditional probabilities are computed. In the second
            stage,with these pseudo values, a complicated survival analysis
            problem is transformed into a regression problem that can be
            effectively solved by broad learning system. The detailed algorithm
            is listed on the right side.

    -  P10—P11

        -  Part three are some results of our experiments. The evaluation
            metric is called C-index, and higher means the better. The last line
            in Table 2 shows the performance of our proposed model. From these
            results ,we can see that our proposed method can achieve superior or
            comparable performance.

    -  P12—P13

        -  The last part is the conclusion. In this paper, a novel two-stage
            method is proposed to model the survival data. In the first stage,
            we compute the pseudo survival probabilities with
            pseudo-observations, and then we make risk predictions based on
            broad learning system in the second stage. To our knowledge, it is
            the first time broad learning system is applied to survival analysis
            with censored data. Rather than the hazard ratio or prognostic index
            in the PH-based models, BroadSurv can directly compute the survival
            probability.And the results show that BLS behaves well in the area
            of survival analysis.

    -  P14

        -  And these are some references.

    - P15

        -  So that is all my presentation. Thank you for listening.

    - Q&A

        -  I’m glad you asked that question.

        -  I appreciate your bringing this to my attention. I’ll have to
            recheck my sources to see what is correct.

        -  That’s an interesting question, but it would take much too long to
            answer it adequately. Perhaps we can discuss it later.

        -  Sorry. I'm afraid I know little about that matter. So I don't think
            I can answer your question right now.

        -  It is a good question and I have no answer at this moment. Can I
            have your e-mail so that I can email you my possible new findings
            later?

        -  Sorry, it seems that you are right. Thank you for pointing out that
            and I will try my best to amend it in my later work.

        -  I’m afraid I don’t understand. Could you please rephrase the
            question?

-  **一些感受**

    -  PPT制作能力还需加强

    -  表达能力还需加强——英文表达

    -  **背景——引入要自然**

    -  公式的说明——每一个字符的表示含义

    -  图表的说明——位置，强调突出等

    -  结论部分的说明

    -  **Q&A部分的应对**

    -  第一次参加做的不太好，但是这第一次参会体验感觉还挺不一样的

    -  学术会议认真对待是能够学习到不少东西的
